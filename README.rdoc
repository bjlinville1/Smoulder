== README

This application is designed to help you do nice things for people you care about by leveraging the mountains of data that companies like google have collected from your loved ones. Essentially, it takes the effort out of being thoughtful.

It is far from a finished product. I have only had time to build and style the basic functionality for this app. The code needs a great deal of clean-up, and I look forward to polishing it till it shines!
